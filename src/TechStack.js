                                Angular is an open-source web application framework developed
                                and maintained by Google. It is a TypeScript-based framework designed for
                                building dynamic, single-page applications. Angular
                                uses a component-based architecture and includes tools like dependency injection,
                                data binding, routing, and form validation. Angular was the first
                                front end framework I learnt, where I used it to build a (pretty rubbish) task manager.
                                It is regarded as one of the more trickier front end frameworks to learn. Angular is
                                considered trickier than React because it is a full-fledged framework with a steeper
                                learning curve, requiring knowledge of concepts like TypeScript, dependency injection,
                                and RxJS. Visit the <a href="https://angular.dev" className="btn btn-learn"> Angular Website

                                React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for
                                building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Similarly to Angular,
                                React follows a component-based architecture where the UI is divided into reusable,
                                independent pieces called components. While Angular's opinionated architecture,
                                two-way data binding, and frequent updates add complexity, Reactâ€™s simpler, flexible,
                                and minimalistic approach focuses mainly on the UI and offers a
                                smoother learning experience. React's one-way data
                                flow and less rigid structure make it easier to start with and more adaptable to various
                                projects. It uses a virtual DOM to
                                optimise rendering performance, making it highly efficient for
                                dynamic and interactive applications. React is the most recent framework I've learnt -
